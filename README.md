# StringProblemSet
This project uses TDD with JUnit 5 to solve "String" problem sets in Java. The questions are from "Cracking The Coding Interview" version 5. The solutions and the testing are my own. 

Questions include:
1.1  Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique chars without additional data structure
1.2 //Was C++ related question. I skipped.
1.3  Given two Strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other. 
1.4 Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20;. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional chars. Use Char Array.
1.5 Implement a method to perform a basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaa would become a2b1c5a3. String wont be longer then original, if so return original string
1.6 given NxN array. Rotate it 90 degrees clockwise
1.7 Write algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.
1.8 Using a method "isSubstring" once how can you tell if two strings are a rotation of each other. ex: "sam" is rotation of "ams"

# How to Run
1)Open project in java IDE. 
2)Navigate to src/test/TestJunit.java
3)Right click and run as JUnit Test. 

Enjoy. Try adding test cases to see if my code holds up. :)
